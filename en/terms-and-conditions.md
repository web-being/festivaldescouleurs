In case of the cancellation of the festival – before the festival begins – the visitors only have the right of the refund of the ticket price (except the Eventbrite sale fee).

4. COLOR POWDER

The organizer is acquiring the natural and environment-friendly color powder from the most reputable sources and it has been tested and extensively used in some of the biggest Holi festivals in North America. The organizer has no knowledge of adverse effects on health or environment of the color powder. However, the following safety and security arrangements are instituted by the organizer:

The visitors are not allowed to bring their own color powder. Only the official color powder of the Holi Festival of Colors – Montreal is allowed on the festival grounds.
Visitors with respiratory problems (asthmatic) are advised not to visit the event.
Visitors with contact lenses are advised to not wear these during the event.
The color powder can cause allergies in rare cases, as well as skin, eye and mucosal irritations. Eyes are to be rinsed with clear water. Paramedics will be on site.
In rare cases the color particles of the powder may get attached to bleached, treated or previously damaged hair. Should someone find color residue in their hair, this is not a coloration but rather small color particles that are still attached to the hair and will fall off after a few washes with normal shampoo. Conditioners should be avoided in these cases.
